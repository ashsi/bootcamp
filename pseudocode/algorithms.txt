# Print Fibonacci series up until nth number.

request input from user "Enter a number"
store user input in integer variable called n

call recursive function fib with input n
do nothing with the output of this function call, as the function has printed the sequence as it was called

define function fib:
	if n is equal to 0
		print 0
		return 0
	if n is equal to 1
		print 1
		return 1
	if n > 1
		set variable fib_n to the result of calling function fib on n-2 added to the result of fib on n-1.
		// maintain fib n = fib n-2 + fib n-1
		print fib_n
		return fib_n
