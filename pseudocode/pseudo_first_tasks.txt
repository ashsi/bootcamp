Task One
--------

# Ask user to input numbers until they input 0 to stop the loop, then print the largest number the user entered.

declare variable n
loop (while user entered number != 0)
	ask user to enter a positive number
		if user's number is not zero
			set n to maximum of existing n and user entered number
		if user's number is zero
			break loop
output n which contains the largest number inputted so far

--------
Task Two
--------

# Read input integers and return their arithmetic mean

define variable n = 0, which keeps track of the number of integers read so far
define variable sum = 0 which keeps track of the sum of the integers read so far
for each integer read 
	increment n and add the integer to sum
if n > 0
	return float(sum)/float(n)


----------
Task Three
----------

# Take a grocery list as input and return an alphabetically ordered list of the items left to buy.

input grocery list
declare empty list of items left to buy
for each item in grocery list
	if item is not bought
		add item to left to buy list
return sorted left to buy list

---------
Task Four
---------

# Convert flowchart of algorithm to pseudocode.

Read X, Y from inputs
set S = X + Y
set A = S / 2
set P = X * Y
print S, A, P

Optional Task
-------------

# Ask user for 4 numbers, add each to a list, print the sorted list.

Create a list of size 4

Ask user to input first number, save to list[0]
Ask user to input second number, save to list[1]
Ask user to input third number, save to list[2]
Ask user to input fourth number, save to list[3]

Sort list:
	if list[0] > list[1] 
		switch list[0] and list[1] // first pair is sorted
	if list[2] > list[3]
		switch list[2] and list[3] // first and second pair are sorted pairs
	if list[0] > list[2]
		switch list[0] and list[2]
		switch list[1] and list[2]
	else if list[1] > list[2]
		switch list[1] and list[2] // first three elements are sorted
	if list[1] > list[3]
		switch list[1] and list[3]
		switch list[2] and list[3]
	else if list[2] > list[3]
		switch list[2] and list[3] // all four elements are sorted


Print list
